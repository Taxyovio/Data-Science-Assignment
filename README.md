This is the first take-home assignment I did back in April 2022, as a part of the interview process for a data science role. The reference to the company has been removed completely to prevent plagiarism. This material was not protected by an NDA or any other agreements to be kept private.

The assignment consists of two parts:

- Predicting store sales using random forecast regressions, and interpreting the results.
- Predicting a two variable function from ~100 data points.
